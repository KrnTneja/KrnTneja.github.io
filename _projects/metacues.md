## Overview

As generative AI systems become increasingly prevalent in search and information retrieval, there is a growing concern about users' over-reliance on AI-generated content without proper critical evaluation. MetaCues addresses this challenge by integrating metacognitive cue techniques into AI search interfaces to enhance users' critical thinking abilities. The system employs strategic cues that encourage users to reflect on their information needs, evaluate AI responses, and develop more sophisticated search strategies.

MetaCues leverages research in metacognition and critical thinking to design interventions that prompt users to:
- Reflect on their search goals and information requirements
- Evaluate the credibility and relevance of AI-generated responses
- Consider alternative perspectives and potential biases
- Develop more effective search strategies through guided reflection
